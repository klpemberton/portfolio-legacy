					<div class="container">
						<div class="one-half">
							<p>Consumers demand a lot from your website. You need it done right. As a professional web developer, I've acquired years of knowledge and in-depth experience in many different web languages and can hand-code your website from scratch, creating a totally custom experience.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="one-half">
							<p>A website is much more than just shiny graphics on a page. Creating a solid website requires the most current coding techniques to ensure the site's code is correct, clean, quick, and secure. Almost anyone can make a website, but not everyone should. Your website is too important to be left to chance.</p>

								<p>In an increasingly mobile world, how can you deliver the same content to all visitors, regardless of the device from which they are visiting? The answer is responsive web design. Rather than redirect your visitors to a separate mobile site where they might miss out on some important content, Responsive Design scales your website's content to the screen resolution of the visitor's device, keeping all important content intact. I have mastered the art and every website I develop is responsive and mobile-ready.</p>

								<li><a class="dpl"><span class="tooltip" title="Drupal">Drupal is a complex CMS that is used more for corporate sites rather than for blogging. The interface is very different from WordPress, but still user-friendly.</span></a></li>
								<li><a class="jm"><span class="tooltip">Joomla is another CMS that again serves the need for storing content in an easily accessible, user-friendly format.</span></a></li>
							</ul>
							<p>The best Content Management System for your needs depends on the specifics of your project. Luckily, I have extensive experience with many CMS platforms and can develop a custom website tailored to your needs, with all content easily updatable via a user-friendly interface. </p>

								<p>A very hot topic for businesses on the web today is SEO, short for Search Engine Optimization. SEO involves structuring your site and content in such a way so as to increase your website's ranking in search engine results. All websites I create are fully search engine optimized for maximum presence.</p>
