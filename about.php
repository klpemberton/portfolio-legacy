						<p>I'm Kristine and I'm a Web Developer. I began creating websites as a little kid (remember <a href="http://geocities.ws/purrfectpetzplace/" target="_blank">Geocities</a>?), and that's still what I do today, with almost 8 years of hands-on professional experience at major corporations in Bloomington, Indiana and now San Luis Obispo, California. I'm currently a full-time Senior Front End Developer at a large corporation in SLO.</p>

						<p>I do have a full-time job but that doesn't mean I don't have time for your project. I love what I do, so I always find time for it. I prefer to focus on just one project at a time to be sure that my work remains of the highest quality, which means your project would be the sole focus of my attention.</p>

						<p class="no-top-margin">I pride myself in constantly learning and keeping my dev skills not only current but ahead of the curve. Web development is not a career for the lazy or complacent. It's constantly and rapidly evolving in many new directions, so luckily it's my passion and I have no problem doing the work to keep up.</p>
