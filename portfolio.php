		            			</div>	
								<h4>Concept</h4>
								<p>Chris Gaal and his staff have built an extensive catalog of community resources during his tenure as Prosecutor. Mr. Gaal contacted me for help with making this wealth of information more readily available to the public via a new website. I initially chose Drupal to be the CMS for this project, however since his staff needed to be able to manage the site upon completion, I went with WordPress due to its lesser learning curve.</p>

								<h4>Concept</h4>
								<p>A+ Service Solutions of Bloomington, Indiana is a servicer, provider, and manufacturer of essential office equipment. The owner has enlisted me to update the design of his existing outdated website, as well as implement and integrate a new e-commerce system.</p>

									<p><a href="http://www.tarpleyservices.com/" target="_blank">http://www.tarpleyservices.com</a></p>
								</div>
								<h4>Concept</h4>
								<p>Tarpley Services provides garage door service, tree work, and various other exterior maintenance services, and has built a strong reputation locally from just word-of-mouth referrals from satisfied customers. While the business is growing based on referrals alone, the owner wishes to expand its growth even further. Simply having a website will provide a huge leg up for the company, since many contracting companies in the area do not see the value in having a website.</p>

								<h2>Liberty Lube & Car Care</h2>

									<p><a href="http://libertylubeandcarcare.kristinepemberton.com" target="_blank">http://www.libertylubeandcarcare.com</a></p>
								</div>
								<h4>Concept</h4>
								<p>The owners of Liberty Lube really had no preconceived idea of how they pictured their website, so I enjoyed much creative freedom throughout the design of this project. I ultimately decided upon a bold, modern design, with sleek lines, professional typography, and high-quality graphics. The tire tread/checkered flag patterns and right-diagonal lines throughout create the impression of forward movement and say without words how fast, yet high-quality, Liberty Lube's service is.</p>

								<h4>Concept</h4>
								<p>GW Worldwide, LLC has been helping individuals and businesses across the globe explore and reduce their energy impact through alternative energy and green building techniques for over 30 years. The owners want the site to emphasize both their global connections and well as their commitment to energy reduction and green building techniques.</p>

										<img src="assets/img/liblubetorchweb.png" alt="Liberty Lube Logo" class="llcc" />
									</a>
								</div>
								<h4>Concept</h4>
								<p>I developed the new logo for Liberty Lube's storefront and website using a bold, block-style font, a morphing checkered flag design, and an illustration of the iconic Liberty Torch. I initially designed this logo to have just the torch and a checkered flag pattern separating the two lines of copy in the logo, however this left me uninspired and looked quite plain. Enter the concept of morphing the checkered flag from a tire tread, which I believe in itself sums up Liberty Lube's mission statement: quality car care at a fast but uncomprimising pace.</p>

								<h2>Tarpley Services, Inc.</h2>

										<img src="assets/img/tsweblogo3.png" alt="Tarpley Services Logo" class="tsi" />
									</a>
								</div>
								<h4>Concept</h4>
								<p>Tarpley Services, Inc. specializes in garage doors and tree work, but also provides a wide range of other exterior maintenance services. I needed to think of a way to visually summarize the variety of work that Tarpley Services can perform. The concept of the house/building inside the jaws of the wrench symbolizes that Tarpley Services can provide maintenance services to many aspects of your home, in essence encompassing your property with the quality workmanship and customer care on which Tarpley Services, Inc. has built its reputation.</p>
